mov bx, 50
sub bx, 50
// the sub will modify the flags register as well

flags register 
    - ZF (zero)
    - PF (parity)
    - SF (sign)
    - OF (overflow)
    - AF ...
    - DF ...
    - TF ...

====
ZF
====
if the result of an arithmetic operation is 0,
    - then set ZF to 1
    - else set ZF to 0

====
SF
====
for arithmetic operations,
    set to 1 if most significant bit is 1, else 0

signed vs unsigned are slightly different for MUL
